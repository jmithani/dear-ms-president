# Dear Ms. President
Computational poem composed during a workshop with [Nick Montfort](http://nickm.com/) in 2015. It is a remix of ["Love Letters"](http://nickm.com/memslam/love_letters.html) by Christopher Strachey (1952) and ["Stochasitc Texts"](http://nickm.com/memslam/stochastic_texts.html) by Theo Lutz (1959). Both have been reimplemented for the modern web by Montfort.

The piece emerged as a result of anxieties felt when looking at a list of past US presidents and not seeing someone who looked like me. The letters are signed by me, but they are generated from a combination of my feelings, my perception of society's thoughts, and potential reactions if we were ever to have a female president.

Reflecting on this past work, it seems especially relevent as Hillary Clinton has officially been named the Democratic Party nominee for the next president of the United States.

Forking and remixing is encouraged.
